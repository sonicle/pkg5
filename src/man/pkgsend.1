.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBpkgsend\fR enables the publication of new packages and new package versions to an image packaging repository using package manifests. To create or manage repositories, see \fBpkgrepo\fR(1). To create package archives from packages in an existing repository, see \fBpkgrecv\fR(1). For more information about package manifests, see \fBpkg\fR(5).
.sp
.LP
After a \fBpkgsend publish\fR operation, if your \fIrepo_uri_or_path\fR repository must support \fBpkg search\fR operations, run \fBpkgrepo refresh\fR on the repository to update search indexes.

.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Read each \fIsource\fR (such as an SVR4 package, a directory, or a \fBtar\fR file) and emit the manifest that describes the \fIsource\fR to \fBstdout\fR. In the output manifest, \fBfile\fR and \fBdir\fR actions have owner set to \fBroot\fR and group set to \fBbin\fR.
.sp
The output manifest can then be annotated, have dependencies added or analyzed using \fBpkgdepend\fR, and have its correctness verified using \fBpkglint\fR before being passed to the \fBpublish\fR subcommand.

.RE

When the specified source is a directory, there is no clear way to distinguish a \fBfile\fR action from a \fBhardlink\fR action when there are multiple path names for a single inode. Normally, the first one found in the file system walk is treated as a file and the rest as hardlinks. This can be arbitrary, depending on the implementation of the file system. To specify which path names should be treated as files, pass each path name as an argument to the \fB--target\fR option. This option has no effect on other types of sources because they are capable of expressing which path names are files and which are hardlinks.
.sp
When SVR4 packages are provided as a source, \fBpkgsend\fR checks that no files with class action scripts are present and no preinstall, postinstall, preremove, or postremove scripts are present. An exception is made for any SMF manifests installed with the \fBmanifest\fR class. \fBBASEDIR\fR is removed from all relocatable paths.
.sp
The SVR4 \fBDESC\fR parameter is converted to a \fBpkg.description\fR value. The SVR4 \fBNAME\fR parameter is converted to a \fBpkg.summary\fR value.

Publish a package using the specified package manifests to the target package repository, retrieving files for the package from the provided sources. If multiple manifests are specified, they are joined in the order provided. If a manifest is not specified, the manifest is read from \fBstdin\fR.
.sp
If not specified, \fBpkgsend publish\fR adds the build version to the package FMRI. The \fBpublish\fR tool also adds the timestamp (the current time in UTC) to the package FMRI. See the \fBpkg\fR(5) man page for information about the version string of a package FMRI.
.sp
If multiple \fBpkgsend publish\fR processes might be publishing to the same \fB-s\fR repository simultaneously, specifying the \fB--no-catalog\fR option is recommended. See the description of the \fB--no-catalog\fR option below.

Add the specified bundle to the list of sources to search when looking for files in the manifest. Bundles are sources such as tar files and SVR4 packages. If this option is specified multiple times, sources are searched in the order they appear on the command line. If both \fB-b\fR and \fB-d\fR are specified, \fB-d\fR sources are searched first. For a description of supported bundles and how they are used, refer to the \fBgenerate\fR subcommand above.

Do not add the package to the publisher's catalog. This option is recommended whenever multiple packages are being published at one time because updates to publisher catalogs must be performed serially. Publication performance might be significantly reduced if this option is not used when multiple processes are simultaneously publishing packages. After publication is complete, the new packages can be added to the respective publisher catalogs by using the \fBpkgrepo refresh\fR command.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
Because of publication protocol limitations, file system based publication must be used when publishing individual package files that are greater than 128 MB in size. File system based publication is also recommended when access control for a repository is needed.
.sp
.LP
When using file system based publication, any \fBpkg.depotd\fR processes that are serving the target repository must be restarted after publication is completed for the changes to be reflected in its web interface or search responses. See \fBpkg.depotd\fR(1M) for more information.
