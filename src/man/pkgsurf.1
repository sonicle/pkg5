pkgsurf \- Image Packaging System repository resurfacing utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
/usr/bin/pkgsurf -s \fItarget_repo\fR -r \fIreference_repo\fR [-n]
    [-p \fIpublisher_prefix\fR]... [-i \fIname\fR]... [-c \fIpattern\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBpkgsurf\fR is a package publication tool for replacing packages in a target repository that have not changed since the latest published version in the reference repository. The result is a new version surface of all packages in the target repository.
.sp
.LP
\fBpkgsurf\fR operations are not reversible. In case the \fBpkgsurf\fR operation must be reverted, you should store the target repository in its own ZFS dataset and take a snapshot of the dataset before you run \fBpkgsurf\fR.
.sp
.LP
Packages in the target repository are compared to packages in the reference repository and analyzed for content changes. For each package, if no content change is found, the package manifest is removed from the target repository and replaced with the manifest of the same package from the reference repository.
.sp
.LP
The target repository must be a file system based repository. For optimal performance, the reference repository should also be a file system based repository.
.sp
.LP
The target repository should contain only one version of each package. If the target repository contains a package that is both newer than the latest version in the reference repository and older than the latest version in the target repository, no package manifest replacement is done for that package.
.sp
.LP
The reference repository can contain one or more versions of each package. However, only the latest version will be used for comparison.
