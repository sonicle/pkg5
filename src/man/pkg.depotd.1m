.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBpkg.depotd\fR is the depot server for the Image Packaging System. It provides network access to the data contained within a package repository. Clients that do not support direct access to a repository through the file system, or for which network access is the only available or preferred method of transport, typically use the package depot.
.sp
.LP
Clients such as \fBpkg\fR, the retrieval client, can retrieve a list of packages and package metadata from a repository directly or through the depot server. \fBpkgsend\fR, the publication client, can send new versions of packages to a repository directly or through the depot server. \fBpkgrepo\fR can be used to create repositories for use with the depot server, or to manage them both directly and through the depot server.
.sp
.LP
\fBpkg.depotd\fR is typically run as a service on the system. Package and software developers might want to run private copies for testing.
.sp
.LP
The depot does not provide any access control methods of its own. By default, all of the clients that are able to connect are able to read all package data and publish new package versions. The exception is that when running under Service Management Facility (SMF), the default is to run in read-only mode. The "Notes" section below describes some best practices for maintaining a public depot server with evolving content.
.SH SMF PROPERTIES
.sp
.LP
The \fBpkg.depotd\fR server is generally configured via the SMF properties associated with its service. The \fBsvc:/application/pkg/server\fR service runs a \fBpkg.depot\fR server process, or contributes configuration to the \fBsvc:/application/pkg/depot\fR service. See the \fBpkg.depot-config\fR(1M) man page and the \fBpkg/standalone\fR property below.
.sp
.LP
See the \fBsmf\fR(5) man page for information about SMF properties. The following properties are recognized:

The package depot is also able to act as a mirror server for local client images from \fBpkg\fR(5). This enables clients that share a subnet on a LAN to mirror their file caches. Clients can download files from one another, thereby reducing load on the package depot server. This functionality is available as an alternate depot service configured by SMF. It uses mDNS and \fBdns-sd\fR for service discovery.

.SH DEPOT CONFIGURATION
.sp
.LP
When a configuration file is provided (instead of an SMF FMRI) by using the \fB--cfg\fR option, the depot server reads and writes all configuration data in a simple text format. The configuration data is described in "SMF Properties" above. The configuration data consists of sections, lead by a \fB[\fIsection\fR]\fR header, and followed by \fBname = \fIvalue\fR\fR entries. Continuations are in the style of RFC 822. Values can be split over multiple lines by beginning continuation lines with whitespace.
.sp
.LP
Any required values not provided in the configuration file must be provided using the option listed in "Options" above. A sample configuration file might look like this:
