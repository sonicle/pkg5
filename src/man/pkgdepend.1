.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpkgdepend\fR command generates and resolves dependencies for packages. A package might depend on files from other packages. The \fBpkgdepend\fR command is typically used in two passes: file dependency generation and file-to-package resolution.
.sp
.LP
The \fBgenerate\fR subcommand examines the content of a package and determines what external files the package needs.
.sp
.LP
The \fBresolve\fR subcommand takes the list of files from the \fBgenerate\fR step, and searches a reference set of packages to determine the names of the packages that contain those dependent files. The reference set of packages that are searched for the dependent files are the packages that are currently installed on the publisher's system.
.sp
.LP
Several components of delivered files are used as sources of dependency information:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fBELF\fR
.ad
.RS 14n
.rt  
ELF headers in delivered files are analyzed for dependency information, with the \fB-k\fR and \fB-D\fR options modifying the information obtained. For more details on ELF dependencies, see \fBldd\fR and the \fILinker and Libraries Guide\fR.

\fBScripts\fR

Shell scripts that contain \fB#!\fR lines referencing an interpreter result in a dependency on the package that delivers that interpreter.

.sp

\fBPython\fR

.RS 14n

Python scripts are first analyzed as scripts. In addition, any imports the script declares might also serve as sources of dependency information.

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-k\fR \fIpath\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Add the \fIpath\fR to the list of run paths to search for kernel modules. Using the \fB-k\fR option removes the default paths, which are \fB/kernel\fR and \fB/usr/kernel\fR.
.sp
Run paths such as those specified by the \fB-k\fR option can also be specified per action or per manifest by using the action or manifest attribute \fBpkg.depend.runpath\fR. The value of the \fBpkg.depend.runpath\fR attribute is a colon-separated string of the paths to use. Setting any \fBpkg.depend.runpath\fR attributes in the manifest or action overrides paths specified with the \fB-k\fR option.
.sp
The special token \fB$PKGDEPEND_RUNPATH\fR can be used as one component of the \fBpkg.depend.runpath\fR attribute value in order to include the standard system run path for the file being analyzed.
.RE

In some cases, you might want to prevent automatic generation of dependencies. For example, if a package delivers a sample Python script that imports a set of modules, those modules imported by the sample script are not dependencies for the package that delivers the sample script. Use the action or manifest attribute \fBpkg.depend.bypass-generate\fR to prevent generating dependencies against the specified files.
.sp
The \fBpkg.depend.bypass-generate\fR values are Python regular expressions that match file names. The regular expressions are implicitly anchored at the start and end of the file path. The value given in the following example matches \fBthis/that\fR but does not match \fBsomething/this/that/the/other\fR.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
pkg.depend.bypass-generate=this/that
.fi
.in -2

For more information about Python regular expression syntax, use the command \fBpydoc re\fR or see more complete documentation at \fBhttp://docs.python.org/dev/howto/regex.html\fR.
.sp
When \fBpkgdepend generate\fR input manifests contain SMF manifest files, any SMF services or instances declared by those SMF manifest files are included in the \fBpkgdepend\fR output. These SMF services or instances are included in the form of a \fBset\fR action with the name \fBorg.opensolaris.smf.fmri\fR.

Transform dependencies on files into dependencies on the packages that deliver those files.
